# Build tool release assets

The launcher and its toolsets have independent versions. `src/tool-assets.json` and `src/mac-tool-assets.json` pin each archive's URL and SHA-256 checksum. Linux x64, Windows x64, and Mac x64/arm64 computers download their matching archive automatically in setup Step 1. Windows produces a native x86_64 game using private MINGW64 GCC, CMake, Ninja, Python, SDL2, and runtime DLLs. Mac tools have an independent version so publishing them does not force Linux or Windows users to download their existing tools again.

## macOS setup

Mac tools download as a separate private archive: CMake, Ninja, Python 3, LLVM object tools (llvm-objcopy), Git, Make, patch, 7-Zip, and shell utilities. Small clang/clang++ wrappers select the compiler from Apple Command Line Tools; an additional compiler is not bundled. Native archives are provided for Intel and Apple Silicon. Mac uses Ninja so tool paths under `Application Support` can contain spaces. The game target remains x86_64. Homebrew is not required and no package manager runs on the user's Mac.

Apple's SDK, compiler/Command Line Tools, and Rosetta are excluded from our archives. Step 1 checks them and shows a guided checklist with copyable Terminal commands when needed. Run `xcode-select --install` and finish Apple's installer first. Apple Silicon also needs `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`. Click **Check again** in Mac setup help, then continue Step 1 to download the private tools. The launcher does not run system installers or accept Apple's licenses automatically. Downloaded files and saves are preserved.

Finder-launched apps prioritize the private archive. Existing tools in `/opt/homebrew`, `/usr/local`, an explicit `HOMEBREW_PREFIX`, and the standard CMake.app location can also be detected for diagnostics. Only child process environments are changed. Checks run asynchronously and cache briefly for UI refreshes; every setup/build attempt checks again. An existing playable build can still launch without requiring the tools to be reinstalled. The port honors `SMS_LLVM_BIN` to keep the private compiler selected even if Homebrew LLVM is present.

## Publish Mac tools

Set a new independent version in `src/mac-tool-assets.json` and clear its `platforms` object. Run **Publish Mac build tool archives** on that branch. The workflow prepares both native conda-forge environments, excludes any SDK/sysroot package, collects corresponding sources and notices, packages them with conda-pack, and compiles the port using each relocated archive plus the runner's Apple toolchain. It publishes `mac-build-tools-<version>` as an immutable prerelease. Download its merged `mac-tool-assets.json` into `src/`, then bump the launcher version. Never reuse a published toolset version.

The installer does not contain the toolchain. Each launcher release also attaches a copy of the pinned tool archives for direct download. Normal launcher updates reuse the installed toolset. Tools are extracted into the app's data folder, separate from game builds, disc images, saves, and backups. A tool replacement is staged, verified, and rolled back if it fails.

## Publish a new toolset

1. On a preparation branch, set a new `toolset` in `src/tool-assets.json` and clear its `platforms` object. Update the pinned bootstrap or package requirements in `scripts/bootstrap-build-tools.js` as needed. Never reuse a published toolset version.
2. Commit and push that branch, then run **Publish build tool archives** in GitHub Actions with that branch selected. Only this workflow runs micromamba/pacman. It builds both toolchains, packages them, unpacks each into a different folder, and compiles the port with the relocated tools and no ROM. Linux uses conda-pack and runs conda-unpack at its final destination. Windows archives exclude package caches and machine-specific home/temp folders; setup recreates the empty folders it needs and uses Windows' built-in extractor when available.
3. Both OS jobs must pass before publication. The workflow publishes `build-tools-<toolset>` as a tooling prerelease, so it does not become the launcher's latest stable update. It includes tool archives, corresponding source archives, notices, and a merged `tool-assets.json`.
4. Download that merged manifest and replace `src/tool-assets.json` with it. Commit the pins and bump the launcher version, then merge the completed branch into `main` to ship the updated setup behavior. The normal launcher release workflow verifies the matching archive before attaching it to each OS release.

The tool archives contain only build dependencies. Port executables, disc images, game assets, texture packs, and user saves never enter the publishing directory. The source archives contain package build recipes, patches, upstream source downloads, license information, and package metadata. Keep these assets available while distributing their toolset.

## Smoke test shipped tools

`npm ci && node scripts/smoke-build-tools.js` downloads the pinned archive and builds a fresh port without a ROM. The **Smoke test build tools** workflow runs this independently of Electron packaging. Linux's build PATH contains only the downloaded tools; Windows uses the private MSYS2 MINGW64 tree, verifies the generated PE executable is AMD64/PE32+, tests low game stacks and thread exits, and starts the game with a missing disc to verify its loader. Mac jobs run `node scripts/smoke-mac-tools.js` on Intel and Apple Silicon, reproduce Finder's minimal PATH, download and relocate the private archive, and compile Sunshine for x86_64 without a ROM. Linux and Windows verify the private compiler; Mac verifies the private compiler wrapper selects Apple’s compiler and llvm-objcopy comes from the archive. Mac also starts the executable with an intentionally missing image and requires the expected disc error, checking that the loader and optional mod imports work. It does not publish the binaries. Eclipse remains experimental on Mac; this test does not verify its separate code-mod build.

During archive publication, `SMS_TOOL_ASSET_MANIFEST=tool-assets/manifest-<platform>.json` tests the local archive before its release exists. This override is only used by the CI script; the app uses the committed checksum pins.


## Independent platform versions

Each entry in `src/tool-assets.json` (Linux/Windows) and `src/mac-tool-assets.json` (Intel/Apple Silicon) has its own `toolset`. The top-level value is retained only for compatibility with earlier manifests. Bump the entry for the OS/architecture being changed, then dispatch its publishing workflow with that platform selected. New releases use `build-tools-<platform-id>-<toolset>` tags, so each archive can ship independently. Adopt the generated manifest entry only after its compilation smoke passes. Never replace existing release assets; bump the tool version instead. The launcher pins archive checksums, reuses unchanged tools, and records the selected platform's tool version/hash in each game build.

The game source selected for all smoke builds is `src/game-release.json`. The launcher release workflow requires these four platform builds before it packages/publishes a launcher version. `npm run update:game` selects a new complete port/decomp revision and bumps the launcher automatically; see the repository README for the release sequence.

Matching tools from earlier launcher installs are reused in place. Changed tool archives install into separate checksum-specific folders, retaining older tools needed by previous game builds. Each build records its compiler tool location, and fallback play uses that location. Removing a recorded tool folder causes the launcher to request preparation again. One launcher instance runs at a time to prevent overlapping game updates or save operations.
